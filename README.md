Brief Game Rules

To further explain the rules let's break it down as follows:
Pacman, our hero, munches his way around the room, eating all of the Pac-dots.
In each corner of the room there is a "Power Pellet", which when Pacman eats one, the Ghosts turn blue or yellow. Pacman can get extra points by eating the Ghosts. The first one is worth 200 points and each additional Ghost eaten is worth double the number of points.
When the player reaches 10,000 points, he gets an additional life - but that only happens once during the game.
These are the rules under which the game is played and yes, although the game itself appears simple and straightforward, it also quite addictive, as once the first level is completed, the player continues onto higher levels.
Further Challenges

In each room, the speed of Pacman and the Ghosts increase making it more difficult to control them with the same accuracy whilst the effective time of the Power Pellets is shortened giving less opportunity to catch each Ghost.
The player can get extra points in each room as "bonus fruit" appear. The number of points given to each fruit varies depending on the room.

Architecture

The idea is to create all the backend logic using javascript tested with jasmine.

After that I will try to use node, express and maybe angular to make a single page app.
